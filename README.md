# Audio-Signal-Processing
Separating two audio signal from one mixed signal using Independent Component Analysis (ICA).

MATLAB is used for this project for various purposes mentioned in Project Report.

Question template:-

1)Record two audio signals using your phone. Describe the recorded signal format, sampling frequency, number of channels and all the details that you feel important to know about this signal. 
2)Convert them to .wav file.  
3)The task is to combine/mix the audio signals as if they speech signals were spoken simultaneously. How do you do it? 
4)How do the spectra of the two signals and the combined signal look like? 
5)How is the audio signal compressed and stored in the memory?  
6)How do you separate two audio signals from one signal? 

You can view the Project report for all the detailed solutions and codes.
